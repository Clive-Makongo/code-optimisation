# <Code Optimisation>

## Description

- The purpose of this project was to amend the code for the purpose of search engine optimisation, user accessibility and consolidating HTML and CSS elements for readabilty and proper logical structure

- I worked on this project in order to improve my understanding of HTML's syntax and logical structure, as well as to best understand how to use CSS selectors for code readibility

- The page now has accurate HTML structure, I have included alt tags for the images as well as correcting a link issue on the page
